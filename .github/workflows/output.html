<p><strong>New Instruction Engine - NIE</strong> is a software product
providing Guidance (or Navigation) service. <strong>Guidance</strong>
refers to the process of providing drivers with information and
directions that can help them reach their desired destinations safely

and other sensors. These systems can be integrated into a carâ€™s
dashboard.</p>

and cover different aspects of guidance. This space provides definitions
