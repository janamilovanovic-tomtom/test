<h1>Definition</h1>
<p>Visual Instruction  (also known as NIP-Next Instruction Panel) is a UI component that is used to visualise Instruction in order to provide Guidance for a driver. Guidance is a complex experience consists of visual instruction, Audio instruction, Map with representation of the route on it and various other elements. Audio and Visual Instructions change in time as vehicle progresses to the manoeuvre point. This logic is described in details in this document: <a href="https://tomtom.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FlaminGO/pages/157679961/Instruction+Triggering+Logic">Instruction Triggering Logic</a>.</p>
<p><a href="./a.html">a</a></p>
<h1>UI Touchpoints</h1>
<p>Visual instruction is represented at following touch point in a car: HUD, Cluster Display, Central unit display. Each of those touch points have different visual design of the NIP and layout. For now we describe only CSD touch point.</p>

<h1>Cluster Display</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Following the <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/c6C8xa5qJAeF1DgSR69zT7/Nav-Cluster-Reference-Vision?node-id=0%3A1">Cluster vision reference ↗️</a> , the Next instruction panel, as part of the cluster display, should be able to easily adapt and scale to the different OEM layouts without compromising usability and the core concepts.<br />
As a part of the system described above, the cluster NIP should be <strong>adaptable, flexible but focused, glanceable, simplified, not distracting and easy to read.</strong></p>

<h3>Adaptiveness</h3>
