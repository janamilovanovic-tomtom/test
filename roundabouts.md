Visual Instruction represents Roundabout schematically.

| **First exit**     | **Third exit**     | **cross, second exit** | **take fifths exit** | **exit roundabout** |

There are use cases when exit instruction doesn't have place. Those happen usually due to close proximity of the entry and exit points. They are so close to each other that can be considered as one.

Roundabouts types
=================

Different configurations of roundabouts require different instruction compositions, therefore, we define separately following categories of roundabouts:

1. **Small / Straight roundabouts** \- the most trivial traffic figures that require minimal instruction for the manoeuvre.

2. **Single lane roundabouts (excluding #1) -** the most common traffic figures that require moderate instruction for the manoeuvre.

3. **Multi-lane roundabouts -** the most complex traffic figures that require the most elaborative instruction for the manoeuvre.

4. **New roundabout type** - hello

1\. Small / straight roundabouts
--------------------------------

Small, straight (both conditions must be present to be classified as such) roundabout are trivial intersections and when crossing, don't require too elaborative instruction. Generic roundabout instruction is long and might be annoying especially if repeated in serial scenarios which are common for small roundabouts, therefore we use more natural format for such scenarios. We rely on _**cross the roundabout**_ when going straight and _**go around the roundabout**_ when going back. Street names announcements are also minimised at those traffic figures.
