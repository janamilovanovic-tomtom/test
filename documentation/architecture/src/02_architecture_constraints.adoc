| Constraint | Explanation

| NDS map format
| NDS specification defines an upper bound on the features that can be delivered for map based
  navigation features. The fundamentals of the format cannot be changed without NDS consortium approval,
  however in NK2 tile data can be augumented since we control the protobuf format used for transfering tiles.

| Map quality
| There will be limited attempt to fix map quality issues in the instruction engine because such
issues should be fixed at map compilation time. The other alternative is to maintain a stack of
workarounds that need constant maintenance due to map compiler improvements.
The consequence is that instruction quality is not only determined by the map
renderer, but also by the map compilation process and the source data.

| NavKit2 client library interface
| NavKit2 client library interfaces already deliver guidance in format that is close to NKW instructions.
  This may be too restrictive for future turn by turn navigation system. After NK2 is delivered it can
  be expected that there will be limitations to changes allowed in the existing interfaces.
  A solution for maintaining compatibility with NK2 SDK may be needed for breaking changes as long
  as HCP3 project is loosely tracking mainline instruction engine.

| General NavKit2 architectural constraints
| NavKit2 non-functional requirements and other constraints such as code portability
  apply to the product as a whole.
