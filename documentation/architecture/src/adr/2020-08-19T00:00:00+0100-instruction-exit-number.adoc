= Adding exit number information to Instruction::Exit

== Status

Implemented

== Context

We need to add exit numbers (vector of strings) to "take the exit" instructions.
https://jira.tomtomgroup.com/browse/NAV-22134

== Decision

Add exit_numbers vector of strings to Instruction::Exit

== Consequences

Since exit member of Instruction is optional, exit_numbers will only be available for "take the exit" instructions
