= Visualisation tool

== Status

Proposed

== Context

We have decided to use KML as our major debugging and analysis file format.  We need a tool to visualise these KMLs.  Currently we use Google Earth, but it isn't very well tuned to our needs.  In particular it doesn't provide any link to the underlying NDS data.

== Decision

We will just keep using Google Earth for the moment.  We will hope that any future tools will either support KML, or support a format we can easily convert to from KML.

== Consequences

* We are dependent on a tool from a direct competitor
* Our tooling doesn't allow for easy comparison to NDS map data
