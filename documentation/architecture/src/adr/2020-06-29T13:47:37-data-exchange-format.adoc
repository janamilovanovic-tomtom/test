= Data Exchange Format

== Status

Proposed

== Context

We have a story to produce a https://jira.tomtomgroup.com/browse/NAV-18163[maneuver coverage report].  We want to build the report using multiple reusable tools which exchange data via static text files.  We need to define a format.

== Decision

We will use KML as the standard format, annotated with custom XML nodes.  Annotations will be in the following forms:

* Metadata from the tool that generated the annotations, stored at the top level
* Placemarks with Points
* Placemarks with LineStrings representing polylines or arcs
* All annotations will be placed in the same hierarchical position (e.g. Folder) as the polyline they belong to
* Other data structures in the file such as Style nodes will be left intact

== Consequences

* We can view our data directly in google earth and other tools
* We have broad compatibility with other tools
* We have great flexibility to define our own data formats
