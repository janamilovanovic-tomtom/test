= Scripting Language for analysing instructions

== Status

Proposed

== Context

We have a story to produce a https://jira.tomtomgroup.com/browse/NAV-18163[maneuver coverage report].  We will build this out of several tools that use KML files as intermediate file formats.  Most of these tools mostly just process XML and do not require access to other TomTom libraries.  They would be best implemented with a scripting language.  Which language?

== Alternatives

* Python
* Ruby
* Javascript

== Decision

Python

== Consequences

* We may be able to utilise scripts earlier written by Omega for analysing the arrival experience at POIs
* Some of us will have to learn how to code in Python
