= Base class for processing KML files

== Status

Proposed

== Context

We have a story to produce a https://jira.tomtomgroup.com/browse/NAV-18163[maneuver coverage report].  There are several analysis operations that need to be performed:

* https://jira.tomtomgroup.com/browse/NAV-18658[Import batchrouter output]
* https://jira.tomtomgroup.com/browse/NAV-18651[Match NIE instruction dumper annotations to batchrouter output]
* https://jira.tomtomgroup.com/browse/NAV-18653[Assess closeness of the match between new and old instructions]
* https://jira.tomtomgroup.com/browse/NAV-18655[Aggregate results]

These all share a common structure: iterate over Placemarks defined in a KML file and add more annotations.  In all cases we will be running these as batch operations across a large number of test routes.

== Decision

The overall driving of a batch operation will be delegated to a dedicated Python class "ProcessFiles".  Each operation will be defined as a subclass of a base class "Processor"

== Consequences

* Each tool will have common command line parameters
* It will be straightforward to write tools
* Operation of the script will be slightly harder to understand
