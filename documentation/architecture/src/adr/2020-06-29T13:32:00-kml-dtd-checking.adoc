= Checking of the KML DTD in the instruction annotation tool

== Status

Proposed

== Context

We have a story to produce a https://jira.tomtomgroup.com/browse/NAV-18163[maneuver coverage report].  The most important component will be a C++ tool to read in a KML file, add annotations, and write the results back to KML.

Should we validate the KML by having the tool use a DTD?

== Decision

We will explore this as an option during development.

== Consequences

* If we use this DTD, we will probably have to check it into our repository
