= Splitting generation of routes and generation of instructions

== Status

Proposed

== Context

We have a story to produce a https://jira.tomtomgroup.com/browse/NAV-18163[maneuver coverage report].  The main tool will be a C++ utility to generate instructions for a route.

== Alternatives

* Define route as an OD pair and generate the route via a C++ call to NKW
* Define route as a polyline in a KML file

== Decision

Define route as a polyline in a KML file

== Consequences

* We will have a more complicated input format
* We will be dependent on far less NK2 infrastructure, including online services.
