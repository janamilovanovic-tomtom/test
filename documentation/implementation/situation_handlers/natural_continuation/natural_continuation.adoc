= Natural Continuation

== Definition

The *Natural Continuation (NC)* is a road situation when it's obvious to the driver how to continue moving on the route, despite the road split, simple or complex intersection he/she should drive through. +
If the instruction engine detects such a situation, then no instructions will be generated for the particular road stretch.

== How do we detect the NC?

Since the NC is possible for different road situations, we have different algorithms: +
* for detecting xref:./intersections.adoc[Natural Continuation at intersections] +
* for detecting xref:./bifurcations.adoc[Natural Continuation at bifurcations]
