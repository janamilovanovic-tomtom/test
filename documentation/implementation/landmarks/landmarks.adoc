= Landmarks

== Definition

*Landmarks* are objects or features of a landscape or town that are easily seen and recognized from a distance,
especially those that enable someone to establish their location. The guidance engine incorporates optional landmark
into the instruction. This landmark may then be used to improve visual or audio guidance.

Common examples of landmarks include "at the traffic light" or "at the end of the road."

== How do we detect the Landmarks?

Since there are different landmarks, we have different algorithms: +
* for detecting xref:./end-of-road.adoc[End of Road] +

== Landmarks priority

Since an instruction may only have one attached landmark, we are selecting the single most appropriate one using the priority as follows (from highest to lowest priority):

- End of Road
- At Traffic Light
