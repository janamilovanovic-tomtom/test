<h1>Need to Full Guidance-dedicated user testing</h1>
<p>NIE is a new navigation design that must be tested not only by internal team, but by real users. This is nessasary to ensure the performance one new system and measuring how it stacks up with the older (NK1) and competition. The purpose of this page is to set up a requirements of such testing, consolidate all related information and eventually, to capture the results. There are 3 types of Testing that can be done in parellel:  </p>
<p><strong>1. Moderated driving test</strong><br />
<strong>2. Analytics based unmoderated test including questionary.</strong><br />
<strong>3. Internal benchmark against competition and NK1.</strong></p>
<h1>Moderated Drive Test</h1>
<p>This type of User test requires setting up a moderated driving sessions alongs predefined and persistent routes. During such tests moderator can capture user's problems and difficulties, even if driver himself is not reflection on those. This makes it extremely effective course of information. Additionally, driving along the same route with multiple people could reveal consistent issues.</p>
<h2>Requirements for Drive Test</h2>

<h1>Analytics based test (unmoderated)</h1>
<p>This type of test is a constant evaluation of the product on real users. It doesn't need to be performed, but require initial setup (analytics) and data analysis system in place. At the moment this type of test could be set up on Amigo platform.</p>
<h2>Requirements for Analytics</h2>
<p>Following events should be captured by the analytics system.</p>

<tr>
<td>Audio ON/OFF</td>
<td>State of the Audio Guidance switch</td>

<h1>Competition benchmark (Internal)</h1>
<p>This type of test could be done internally, bu designers, user researcher, developers. Th purpose of this test is to capture advantages/disadvantages of NIE compared to other navigation systems. It could be setup with dual navigation device and session should be recorded and analysed later.</p>
<p>Following questions could be answered by this test</p>
