<h1>Test Purpose</h1>
<p>Our goal was to have a first hand experience of EV long range driver. We wanted to understand all the pain points associated with it. As a side goal we aimed at testing Guidance and overall Driving experience using both NK1 and NK2 guidance engines.</p>
<h1>Test Setup Issues</h1>
<p>Unfortunately we were not able to connect the Automotive UI to the car via special BT dongle. As a result we could not get readings from the car in real time. This was limiting the test of the associated functionality in Automotive UI, however it was still useful for getting overall experience of EV driver.  </p>
<h1>EV Experience</h1>
<p>In this section we collect all issues related to EV experience.</p>

<td>EV Payment</td>
<td>Each charging spot is owned by different provider who requires to download a dedicated, for this provider only, App for the payment. Setting up the payment turned out to be a long and painful process because only credit cards are accepted. (see the picture attached). Credit cards are not reliable methods for online payments and security is severely lacking. They often fail to be accepted for this reason. How could we address this pain point?<br><br>As a bare minimum, It would be good to have everything set up for payment before the drive and not at the arrival. In order to do this we need to communicate the charging provider information upfront, so drivers could set up everything in safe environment.<br><br>Moreover, our algorithm of selection of charging stations should prioritise known (used already) providers over the new ones, that require a new setup.</td>

<td>Range anxiety before the drive</td>
<td>Even before the drive started we had serious doubts that stations that have been selected on the way will be there and we will actually manage to charge. Therefore we checked upfront that those stations were not the only ones in the proximity, and only after that check, we proceeded with drive.<br><br>We should always show other (alternative) charging stations if they are available in the area. Maybe we should make it clear that there are alternatives that can be reached even in worse scenario.</td>

<tr>
<td>Range estimation</td>
<td>It turns out that car range estimation is highly dependant on external conditions such as passengers amount, car speed, wind, rain. Different combination of those create different ranges and in our experience calculation were all wrong. We cannot really rely on the range and assume it will be correct, but rather plan for easy change of charging stops without bothering drivers and making it transparent to avoid range anxiety.  <br><br>  Moreover, more conservative thresholds should be used (20% instead of 10%) in order to avoid recalculations on the way.</td>

<td>Map viewport optimisation</td>
<td>Map view was very unsatisfactory during the trip specifically on highways. In general, viewport is not optimised at all for guidance on highways and was just useless most of the time. Most noticeable issues:<br><br>ISSUE: On long stretches of highway, map was zoomed in and showed empty map all the time which was moving very fast.  SOLUTION: Map viewport is zoomed out much more and map is more tilted to show more horizon. No fast map movement. <br><br>   ISSUE: During turns to the left, map was useless because NIP covers the turn. <br><br> SOLUTION: Shift map centre in order to embrace manoeuvre.<br><br>ISSUE: During the manoeuvre on intersections, the whole manoeuvre is not visible <br><br> SOLUTION: optimise map viewport to embrace the manoeuvre.</td>
