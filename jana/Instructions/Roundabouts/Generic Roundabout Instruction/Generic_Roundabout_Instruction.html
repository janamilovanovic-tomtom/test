<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>This is a revision of the original design. As  a result of the evaluation of Roundabouts instructions we received the following feedback:</p>

</table>
<p>Roundabouts are complicated intersection type that require special instruction for handling. Typically driving through roundabouts poses following challenges: It is not easy to identify correct exit, especially if there are many and directions are not straight. The challenge is amplified by the fact that decision should be made very fast. To address this we must prepare the driver upfront and provide him necessary information that could be applied instantly. Typical method of guidance trough roundabouts is mentioning the <strong>number of exit</strong> (counted from the entry point) that has to be taken. It is relatively easy to count exits for the driver, however this could be complicated if exits are mixed up with entries. It is not always easy to distinguish entries from exits especially when it needs to be done very fast during counting.  </p>
<h1>Roundabout Instruction Architecture</h1>
<p>Unlike, general instruction template, roundabout manoeuvre doesn't take place at one point but has a stretch of the road with two key points: entry and exit. To reflect this, the instruction has different architecture and consists of two parts:</p>
<p><strong>Entry Roundabout instruction</strong> - Given for the entry as a manoeuvre point. Instructs how to perform whole Roundabout manoeuvre from entry to exit. <br />
<strong>Exit roundabout instruction</strong> - Given for the exit as manoeuvre point. Only instructs how to perform the exit roundabout manoeuvre, while being already on the roundabout.</p>
<p><img alt="Big Roundabouts Instruction.svg" src="images/306088039.svg" /></p>
<p><strong>Roundabout Instruction schematic diagram.</strong><br />
Technically, Roundabout manoeuvre is a sequence of two independent manoeuvres: <strong>Roundabout entry</strong> and <strong>Roundabout Exit</strong>  reference point for the entry is entry point and for the exit - exit. Those two manoeuvres have associated with them instructions which are depicted in corresponding Blue and Green colors on the diagram above.</p>
<h2>Next Instruction panel</h2>
<p>Design of Next instruction panel and Audio announcement depends on lane configuration at the roundabout, therefore we will be covering <strong>single-lane</strong> roundabouts and <strong>multi-lane</strong> separately.</p>

<h3>SLG logic for multi-lane roundabouts</h3>
<p>Multi-lane roundabouts lane recommendation should be gathered from lane connectivity data. Typically, the rightmost lane is connected with the first exit. Second and third to the second exit. Leftmost lane to the 3rd and further exits. This principle, however, could be broken and lane connectivity In those cases the only way to know which lane should be recommended is to read lane markings which are usually drawn on the surface of the road. Generally, when lane connectivity is in place it should be used for gathering recommended lane. And only when all lanes are connected to the target exit equally, we should apply generic lane logic.</p>

<h2>When Exit instruction is omitted?</h2>
<p>There are use cases when exit instruction doesn't have place. Those happen usually due to close proximity of the entry and exit points. They are so close to each other that can be considered as one.</p>

For this scenario we should have a method of skipping the exit instruction if time is not sufficient for it. Threshold of travel distance from entry to exit should be defined. Initial value is: \~80m (is it correct value?). To be refined experimentally while driving through small roundabouts.</td>

<h1>Roundabouts types</h1>
<p>Different configurations of roundabouts require different instruction compositions, therefore, we define separately following categories of roundabouts:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Small / Straight roundabouts</strong> - the most trivial traffic figures that require minimal instruction for the manoeuvre.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Single lane roundabouts (excluding #1) -</strong> the most common traffic figures that require moderate instruction for the manoeuvre.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Multi-lane roundabouts -</strong> the most complex traffic figures that require the most elaborative instruction for the manoeuvre.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>1. Small / straight roundabouts</h2>
<p>Small, straight (both conditions must be present to be classified as such) roundabout are trivial intersections and when crossing, don't require too elaborative instruction. Generic roundabout instruction is long and might be annoying especially if repeated in serial scenarios which are common for small roundabouts, therefore we use more natural format for such scenarios. We rely on <em><strong>cross the roundabout</strong></em> when going straight and <em><strong>go around the roundabout</strong></em> when going back. Street names announcements are also minimised at those traffic figures.</p>

<h2>Single-Lane Roundabouts (excluding Small/Straight)</h2>
<p>Any roundabout that doesn't fall under category of Small, Straight roundabouts and doesn't have multiple lanes is single lane roundabout.  It uses generic instruction composition using <em><strong>take the num Exit</strong></em> every time including straight and back directions. This is due to the fact that it is hard to rely on abstract directions when travelling along on medium/large circle.</p>
<h2>Multi-Lane Roundabouts</h2>
<p>Roundabouts that have lane dividers along their circle. Those roundabouts are large in diameter and require correct lane selection at the entry point. Those roundabout instructions focus on lane guidance <strong>Stay in/Take the</strong> <em><strong>num</strong></em> <strong>Right/Left lanes to take the num Exit.</strong> This composition could also be used for <strong>Turbo roundabouts.</strong></p>
<h1>Roundabout Instruction composition</h1>
<p>Based on the categorisation of roundabouts defined above, we will define instruction composition for each type separately.</p>
<h2>Small/Straight Roundabout instruction composition</h2>
<p><strong>(distance) + (pointer) + (action) + (purpose) + (direction)</strong>  - this general structure is used, however, as with all other instruction types some components are optional. The general principle of handling such roundabouts is usage of <em><strong>cross the roundabout</strong></em> and <em><strong>go around the roundabout</strong></em> actions which are only applicable for small roundabouts.</p>

<h1>Roundabout exits counting (identifying <em>num</em> parameter)</h1>
<p>Roundabout exits can have various angles relative to the direction of entry. NIE supports max 8 exits. All possible directions must be mapped to 8(max.) directions.  Each exit is identified by a number which is going counterclockwise. NOTE: For Right handed driving countries (UK, Japan) the direction is inverted.</p>

<h3>Dealing with Tangential exits</h3>
<p>Tangential exits, technically, are not belongs to a roundabout as they bypass it via dedicated straight paths. Those exits should not be counted and should not even be considered as roundabout instructions. I</p>

If the route passes through a roundabout (has at least one roundabout arc) then a roundabout instruction is generated. If the route just includes a roundabout junction and doesn't include a roundabout arc, roundabout instruction is not generated.</td>
