<h1>Terminology used in this document</h1>
<p>This page contains the definitions of some terms used in motorway guidance. The purpose is to bring them to alignment with the developers, the UX, and the product.</p>
<p><strong>Intersection</strong> - is a point at which two or more roads cross or meet. From the developer's point of view, it's an NDS junction that has at least three outgoing arcs. Intersections are T-intersections, Y-intersections, forks, N-way intersections, and so on...</p>
<p><strong>Road situation</strong> - is a route stretch at the junction where the instruction engine intentionally produces or suppresses the instruction. It's a pattern that consists of a set of rules. If rules are satisfied, then the road situation is detected.  Road situations may have the same names as intersections where they appear (e.g. bifurcation).</p>
<p>Important! It's possible to have different road situations at the same intersections depending on the route stretch.<br />
Let's analyze this intersection on the motorway as an example:<br />
<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/51%C2%B014">https://www.google.com/maps/place/51%C2%B014'02.3%22N+6%C2%B042'30.3%22E/@51.2338295,6.7084049,193m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m4!3m3!8m2!3d51.2339843!4d6.7084164?entry=ttu</a></p>
<p>This intersection type is a bifurcation since the road splits without interrupting the traffic flow.<br />
If the route goes through the right branch - then it's an exit road situation since it leads from a motorway to a non-motorway road:<br />
<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/51.2334091,6.7115605/51.2361533,6.7032187/@51.2346495,6.7048156,725m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m2!4m1!3e0?entry=ttu">https://www.google.com/maps/dir/51.2334091,6.7115605/51.2361533,6.7032187/@51.2346495,6.7048156,725m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m2!4m1!3e0?entry=ttu</a></p>
<p>If the route continues straight - it's a natural continuation situation since the driver does not need any instruction to pass through this intersection:<br />
<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/51.2334091,6.7115605/51.2345804,6.7052171/@51.2338614,6.7071022,363m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m2!4m1!3e0?entry=ttu">https://www.google.com/maps/dir/51.2334091,6.7115605/51.2345804,6.7052171/@51.2338614,6.7071022,363m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m2!4m1!3e0?entry=ttu</a></p>
<p>This way, it's possible to have a natural continuation road situation at the bifurcation intersection type. </p>
<p><strong>Motorway</strong> - is a road whose corresponding arc has either the IsMotorway flag set to true or the IsControlledAccess flag set to true and a specified minimum speed limit of 80 km/h.</p>
<p><strong>Fork</strong> - is an intersection type where the road splits without interrupting the traffic flow.</p>
<p><strong>Bifurcation (intersection type)</strong> - is a fork with two outgoing roads. </p>
<p><strong>Bifurcation (road situation)</strong> - is a road situation that happens on bifurcations (intersection type) only and always requires a fork(left, right) instruction to take one of the two possible options.</p>
<p><strong>Trifurcation (intersection type)</strong>  - is a fork with three outgoing roads.</p>
<p><strong>Trifurcation (road situation)</strong> - is a road situation that happens on trifurcations (intersection type) only and always requires fork(left, middle, right) instruction to take one of the three possible options.</p>
<p><strong>Highway</strong> <strong>Switch</strong> - is a road situation that happens on motorways and requires a special switch highway instruction to leave the current motorway (via exit or fork) in order to take another one.</p>
<p><strong>Exit</strong> - is a road situation which happens at forks and requires special exit instruction to leave the current motorway.</p>
<p><strong>Natural</strong> <strong>Continuation</strong> - is a group of road situations when the driver does not need any instruction to pass through the intersection and stay on the route.</p>
