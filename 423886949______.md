**Motivation**
--------------

Successive turns positioned close to each other are very common road network pattern in dense urban areas. This configuration poses certain challenges for drivers following guidance instructions. Since tho possibilities for the turn are too close, drivers tend to take the first one, while the correct turn could be the second. This is is recognised as a common error scenario and our goal is to mitigate it.

Current instruction setup looks like this for urban areas:

|  | **Main** | **Confirmation** | **Notes** |
|---|---|---|---|
| Announcement | in 400 meters turn right | turn right | Confirmation announcement can be given just in time when passing the first (wrong) turn, leading to an error. |
| Distance | 400\-200 meters | 50\-10 meters | Ther are several turns can be positioned in 50m range in dense Urban areas. |

Design
======

To mitigate the potential error and ensure that driver takes the right turn when several possibilities re present, we have to use following approach:

1.  Make triggering point for confirmation phase to be aware of road network configuration.
    
2.  Change audio announcement to communicate the second turn presence.
    

Following diagram depicts the scenario described above:
