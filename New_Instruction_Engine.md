**New Instruction Engine - NIE** is a software product providing Guidance (or Navigation) service. **Guidance** refers to the process of providing drivers with information and directions that can help them reach their desired destinations safely and efficiently.

Car navigation systems are designed to provide guidance to drivers by using a variety of technologies, such as GPS tracking, mapping software, and other sensors. These systems can be integrated into a car's dashboard.

TomTom provides a set of guidance methods that operate simultaneously and cover different aspects of guidance. This space provides definitions of methods and components of NIE.
