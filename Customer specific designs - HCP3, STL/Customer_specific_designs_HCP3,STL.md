TT has a number of customers for whom various levels of solutions are provided. Often those customers have special requirements that must be fulfilled. Those requirements might deviate from our reference design. This section contains any deviations from TomTom reference designs intended to support specific customers requests. At the moment only customised designs are HCP3 and STL .
