Motivation
==========

Traffic rules and driving patters are different across the world. It is impossible to come with one logic that would work properly in Europe and Japan. Our goal is to comply with different traffic rules and patterns that are used locally. To achieve this we have to create a special design patterns to support those localities. This space will collect all guidance differences specific for different regions.
