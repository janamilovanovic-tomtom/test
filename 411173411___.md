**Introduction to Bus / Public transport lanes**
================================================

Bus or public transport lanes are designated lanes on roads exclusively or primarily reserved for buses and, in some cases, other forms of public or high-occupancy transport. Their purpose is to improve the efficiency and reliability of public transportation by giving buses priority over other traffic, reducing delays caused by congestion.

**Purpose**:

*   **Traffic Flow Optimization**: Reducing delays for buses by separating them from general traffic.
    
*   **Encouraging Public Transport Usage**: Providing faster, more reliable travel times incentivizes people to choose buses over private cars.
    
*   **Environmental Benefits**: Supporting public transportation can reduce emissions by minimizing the number of private vehicles on the road.
    
*   **Equity**: Enhances accessibility for those who depend on public transport.
    

**Universal Logic and Traffic Rules Around Bus/Public Lanes**
-------------------------------------------------------------

While exact rules may vary by region, the following are common principles:

**Priority Access:**

*   Bus lanes are reserved for public buses and often allow other high-occupancy vehicles (HOV), bicycles, motorcycles, and taxis.
    
*   Emergency vehicles (e.g., ambulances, fire trucks) can usually use bus lanes.
    

**Time Restrictions:**

*   Some bus lanes are operational only during specific hours (e.g., rush hours).
    
*   Outside these hours, other vehicles may be allowed to use them.
    

**Turning Rules:**

*   Private vehicles may cross bus lanes to make a turn (left or right) but must yield to buses.
    
*   Stopping or waiting in bus lanes is typically prohibited.
    

**Parking Restrictions:**

*   No parking, stopping, or loading is allowed in active bus lanes.
    

**Penalties:**

*   Unauthorized use of bus lanes usually results in fines, camera enforcement, or both.
    
*   Repeat offenders may face higher penalties in some jurisdictions.
    

**Marking and Visualization of Bus/Public Lanes Across Regions**
================================================================

**General Features:**

*   **Color Coding**: Many regions use colored surfaces for bus lanes:
    
*   **Red or Yellow**: Indicates exclusivity and high visibility (common in Europe and Asia).
    
*   **White Markings**: Delineates bus lanes in areas without colored pavement.
    

*   **Lane Signage**:
    
*   Overhead or roadside signs show lane restrictions, applicable hours, and allowed vehicles.
    
*   Symbols like “BUS” or “HOV” are painted directly onto the lanes.
    

*   **Lane Separation**:
    
*   Solid lines to prevent unauthorized vehicles from entering.
    
*   Broken lines allow entry for permitted turns or merging.
    

**Examples by Region:**

*   **North America**:
    
*   Many U.S. cities use red-colored bus lanes in high-density areas.
    
*   Shared bus-bike lanes are common.
    

*   **Europe**:
    
*   Bus lanes often have additional rules allowing taxis or HOVs.
    
*   Red lanes are standard in cities like London and Berlin.
    

*   **Asia**:
    
*   Bus-only corridors with separated lanes are prominent in places like China and India.
    
*   Clear demarcation and heavy enforcement through cameras.
    

*   **Australia/New Zealand**:
    
*   Green-colored lanes for bus and bicycle use are common.
    

**Regional Local Rules Around Bus/Public Lanes**
================================================

**North America:**

*   **United States**:
    
*   **New York City**: Bus lanes are strictly enforced with cameras; fines increase for repeat violations. Some lanes are bus-only 24/7, while others are time-restricted.
    

![image-20241120-102029.png](images/411601850.png)

*   **Los Angeles**: Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) corridors use fully segregated lanes.
    
*   **Canada**:
    
*   Toronto allows taxis and bicycles in bus lanes but enforces strict penalties for private cars.
    
*   Time restrictions are commonly displayed on signs.
    

**Europe:**

*   **United Kingdom**:
    
*   London operates 24-hour bus lanes in central areas, allowing buses, taxis, and bicycles. Dedicated lanes can be used by motorcycles in some cases.  
    
    ![image-20241120-102131.png](images/411569402.png)
    
*   **Germany**:
    
*   Bus lanes are heavily enforced and may permit trams. Many lanes are designated for specific hours.
    
*   **France**:
    
*   Bus lanes in Paris allow taxis and bicycles but are closed to private cars entirely.
    
*   **Scandinavia**:
    
*   Pedestrian crossings and intersections with bus lanes often have priority systems for buses.
    

**Asia:**

*   **India**:
    
*   Dedicated BRT lanes with physical barriers are common in cities like Ahmedabad and Delhi.
    
*   **China**:
    
*   Bus-only roads are separate from general traffic with advanced priority signaling.
    
*   **Japan**:
    
*   Bus lanes are shared with taxis and cyclists, with dedicated signage to indicate operational times.
    

**Australia/New Zealand:**

*   Bus lanes are marked with clear green paint. Some cities, like Sydney, have camera-enforced bus lanes with penalties for unauthorized vehicles.
    

Lane guidance design principles for Bus Lanes.
==============================================

Regional rules around bus lanes differ across the regions, therefore it would be wise to come up with universal logic first - that works everywhere and also specify local deviations if we decide so.

Basic Universal methods of bus lanes handling:

*   Bus lanes should be visualised along with normal lanes in SLG module
    
*   Bus lanes should be marked as such in the SLG module
    
*   Bus lanes can be highlighted (recommended) for turns and crossings if they are positioned outmost (left/right) of the road. Center bus lanes should never be recommended.
    

Open Questions

*   Do we have data on time based bus lanes? And do we want to support it?
    
*   Solid separators should be respected and such lanes should not be recommended. Do we have data on separation lanes?
    
*   Do we want to reflect bus lanes color coding? This is difficult question, as colors might interfere with highlighting methods. Also it is not clear if we can gather colors reliably.
    
*   Can we gather data on color coding?
    
*   For outmost positioned bus lanes, can we know if those lanes are allowed for manoeuvre taking for private vehicles? Can we recommend those lanes?
    

Bus Lane design
===============

Bus lane handling depends on where the bus lane/s positioned. There are two possibilities: _**outmost**_ positioning and _**center line**_.

Outmost positioned bus lanes
----------------------------

Bus dedicated lane that is positioned outmost of the road, allows using it for turn manoeuvres. This lane should be indicated as a bus lane via using iconography / text, or/and colors (appropriate for the region). Example below depicts turn instruction from the rightmost bus lane. Blue background represents bus lane (in Korea) and additionally, bus icon (generic) can be used to reinforce the meaning of the color.

Center positioned bus lanes
---------------------------

Bus lanes that positioned in the middle of other lanes. In other words, there is always another, non-bus lane on both right and left sides of bus lane. Those lanes can never be recommended, and are always greyed out.
